# SpaceSalmon
Github repository of our [Phaser.io](https://phaser.io/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-3-game) game Space Salmon

## Description
Space Salmon is a endless platformer, where a salmon flops his way through space!

## How it works
There are three types of movement: left, right and jump.
When the salmon jumps and reaches a platform, a new one will be created above, the screen will expand, and the score will be updated.
This game will use chromecast functionnalities to display the game and control the salmon.
