# SpacePoyo
Github repository of our [Pixi.js](https://pixijs.com/) game Space Poyo

## Description
Space Poyo is a endless platformer, where poyo flops his way through space!

## How it works
There are three types of movement: left, right and jump.
When poyo jumps and reaches a platform, a new one will be created above, the screen will expand, and the score will be updated.
This game will use chromecast functionnalities to display the game and control poyo.
